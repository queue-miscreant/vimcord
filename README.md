TODOs

Done:
- ctrl-g
- link visiting
- opengraph extmarks
- Add message to named channel (no replies) (KINDA)
- rely on vimscript functions more
- status bar
- Remove `raw_message` from data sent to buffer
- reply extmarks
- reply @ completion
- Globalize variables like reply buffer
- temp buffer for messages
- media links (videos, images) available from vim with alt-g (for image previews, etc)

Todo:
- sign column tricks for private messages (display user connection status?)
- sorting buffer

- Syntax for discord markdown-like

- Try using extmarks for usernames?
- vertical tabs for stuff and things
- show visited links with extmark highlights instead of syntax

- separate discord content out from "normal" reply window/message window pipeline
- variable cleanup

- Future
    - Multiple buffers: main accumulator, but can open one for each channel
